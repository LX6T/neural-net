# neural-net
My implementation of a neural network from scratch (no libraries), including classes for handling image processing and matrix algebra.
Network is designed to train on the MNIST dataset (not included in repo), identifying numbers from 0-9.

Remember to set the paths to `mnist_train.csv` and `mnist_test.csv` in `main.cpp` before executing.
